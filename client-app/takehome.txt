-- it is not obligatory to use routing in an application if it is small
we haven't been using routing in our application until section 8 (we used conditionals like selectedActivity && <ActivityDetails /> in order to show the activity details component based on a certain logic)

-- methods while still without routing (conditional rendering)
    selectActivity = (id: string) => {
        this.selectedActivity = this.activityRegistry.get(id);
    }
    cancelSelectedActivity = () => {
        this.selectedActivity = undefined;
    }
    openForm = (id?: string) => {
        id ? this.selectActivity(id) : this.cancelSelectedActivity();
        this.editMode = true;
    }
    closeForm = () => {
        this.editMode = false;
    }

-- the switch in react router specifies that only one route can be accessed at any one-time,
if we use the Route tags only we might end up with more than one Route accessed together 
in the case of error component for example the switch solved that
